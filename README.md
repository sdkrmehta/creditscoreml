# CreditScoreML

This project focuses on **classifying credit scores** using machine learning techniques.  
The aim is to analyze financial and personal data and predict the **credit score category** of an individual.

This project was created as part of my learning process to understand **data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation** using Python.

## Project Overview

CreditScoreML is an important problem in the finance domain, as it helps lenders understand the creditworthiness of individuals.  
In this project, a dataset containing user financial details is used to train a machine learning model that predicts credit score classes.

The complete workflow is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Purpose of the Project

The main goal of this project was to:

- Learn how to clean and prepare real-world data

- Understand the steps involved in building a classification model

- Gain hands-on experience with machine learning workflows

- This project helped me strengthen my understanding of data analysis and model evaluation.
